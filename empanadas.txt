Empanadas

1 pound ground beef
1 garlic clove, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

1 15 ounce can corn (or frozen), drained
1/2 cup chopped onions
8 ounces grated cheddar cheese
1 cup salsa

2 16 ounce cans large refrigerated biscuits

Brown the ground beef in a frying pan with the garlic.  Add salt and
pepper.  Remove from heat and let cool.

In a large bowl, mix the corn, onions, cheese, and salsa.  Add the
cooled beef, mixing carefully so not to break up all of the cheese.

Roll the biscuits out flat to about 2-1/2 times their size.

Place about 1/3 cup filling on one side of the circle.  Fold the dough
over the filling like a turnover, and crimp the edges with a fork.

Place on lightly greased cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees F until
lightly browned, about 12 minutes.
