Stuffed Bison Peppers

1 pound Ground Bison Burger
4 bell peppers (any color)
4-5 roma tomatoes
1 teaspoon minced garlic
dash Worcestershire sauce
2 cups cooked rice
1 onion, diced
olive oil
salt, pepper, oregano, to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over
high heat. Cut tops off of bell peppers and remove seeds and
insides. Add peppers to boiling water and keep completely under water
for about 3 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onions and garlic
until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. In a medium
sized bowl, mix meat, rice, tomatoes, onion, garlic and seasonings
until well blended.

Drizzle a small amount of olive oil inside the peppers and arrange in
a baking dish. Stuff the peppers with prepared filling. Place peppers
in oven and bake for 40-50 minutes.
