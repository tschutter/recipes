Chicken Philly Cheesesteaks

2 tablespoons olive oil
1-1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into strips
1 onion, sliced
1 bell pepper, sliced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

4 hoagie rolls, split
8 slices provolone cheese

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken,
onion, and bell pepper.  Season with salt and pepper and cook until
the chicken has browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

Heat broiler.  Fill the rolls with the chicken mixture, top with the
provolone, and place on a rimmed baking sheet.  Broil until the
provolone has melted, 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve with french fries.
