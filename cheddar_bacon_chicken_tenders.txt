Cheddar Bacon Chicken Tenders

6 slices of bacon (3/4 cup) [adjust # of slices]

2 eggs
1 cup panko bread crumbs
3/4 cup cheddar cheese, finely grated

1-1/2 pounds chicken tenders

Cook the bacon and put aside to cool.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Spray a large baking sheet with
cooking spray.

In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs.

In a separate shallow bowl, mix the bread crumbs, bacon bits, and
cheddar cheese.

Dip each piece of chicken in the egg, roll in the breading, and place
on the baking sheet.  Press any remaining breading on top of the
chicken.

Bake for 15-25 minutes until the chicken is no longer pink inside and
the coating is golden brown.
