Carne de Puerco (Shredded Pork)
-------------------------------

- 1/3 pound pork tenderloin
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
- 6 whole mild green chiles, canned
- 1 cup malt vinegar
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 cup guava nectar
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

Rinse the pork tenderloin and pat dry with a paper towel.  Remove
fat.  Make several shallow crosswise cuts in the meat.

In a mortar, combine cumin, nutmeg, oregano, chili powder, and white
pepper.  Grind to release flavors and mix spices.  Rub the meat with
the spice mixture, place it in a deep glass or ceramic casserole dish,
and set aside.

To make marinade, in a blender combine green chiles, malt vinegar,
olive oil, guava nectar, pineapple juice, garlic and salt.  Pour mix
over pork and marinate at room temperature for one hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Coat pork with marinade and bake for
two hours.

Remove and let cool in juices.  Remove pork to a large cutting board
and pat dry.  Pour off juices (or reserve for other uses such as
gravy).  With a fork, shred meat finely.  Place shredded pork in a
casserole dish and return to oven.  Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 30
minutes or until crisp on top.

Carne de puerco is used as a filling for tacos, enchiladas, or any
recipe that calls for shredded meat.
