Corn and Red Pepper Chowder
---------------------------

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 leeks, washed and sliced, OR 10 scallions, sliced
- 2 carrots, chopped fine
- 2 red bell peppers, diced
- 4 medium red potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch dice
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 2 cups low-fat or regular milk
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
- 8 ears sweet corn, OR 4 cups corn kernels
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley

Heat the oil in a 4-6-quart Dutch oven. Add the leeks and carrots and
saute over low heat for 5 minutes without browning.

Stir in the red peppers and saute 3 minutes longer.

Add the potatoes, chicken stock, milk, bay leaf, thyme, and black
pepper. Cover partially and simmer for 20 minutes, until the potatoes
are tender but not falling apart.

Using a sharp knife and working from top to bottom, remove the corn
kernels from the cob. Scrape off all the pulp.

Crush about 1/3 of the cooked vegetables and add the corn to the
kettle. Simmer for 10 minutes.

Sprinkle parsley on top of each serving.
