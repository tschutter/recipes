Sirloin Tip Roast
-----------------

- 2-4 pound sirloin tip roast
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

Bring roast to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees
F. Season the roast with paprika, salt, fresh ground black pepper,
oregano, and thyme. Finish the roast by rubbing on olive oil.

Put the roast in the roasting pan.  Cook at 500 degrees F for 20
minutes. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F.  A roast is considered rare
when the internal temperature is at 125 degrees F, medium at 145
degrees F, and well done at 165 degrees F.

Let the roast rest for 20 minutes before you cutting.  Slice it thinly
and against the grain.
