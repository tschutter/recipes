Green Chili
-----------

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 1/2 cups chopped onion
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and veins removed, minced
- 4 green peppers, roasted, peeled and coarsely chopped
- 2 tablespoons oregano
- 2 1/2 to 3 lbs boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 5 cups chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 lb potato, grated
- 1 27-ounce can roasted, peeled green chilies

Heat oil in large, heavy pot. Add the onions, garlic and jalapenos and
saute over low heat until soft and onions are translucent, about 8 to
10 minutes.

Add the pork and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until well
browned.

Add the roasted green peppers, oregano, chicken broth, and salt and
bring to a boil. Then add the grated potato and simmer for 1 1/2
hours, stirring often.

Coarsely chop the green chilies, add them to the pot and cook,
stirring often, for another 30 to 45 minutes, or until pork is
tender. Taste and correct seasonings.

Serve over rice.

Note: To roast peppers, rub them lightly with oil, then roast over an
open flame or under a broiler, turning frequently. Place in a covered
bowl. When cool enough to handle, peel skins off.
