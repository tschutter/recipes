Sweet and Spicy Pecans
----------------------

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1-1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1-1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 egg white
- 2 cups pecan halves

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.

Spray a nonstick baking sheet with cooking spray.

Mix the sugar and spices together in a small bowl.  Beat the egg white
lightly with a fork in a large bowl.  Toss in the pecans and stir to
coat.  Sprinkle with the spice mixture and coat the pecans evenly.
Using your fingers, one by one lift the pecans out of the bowl and
transfer to a baking sheet, separating them as best you can.  Discard
any leftover sugar-egg mix.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes.  Then transfer to
another baking sheet, breaking pecans apart as necessary.  Let cool
completely.

Kept covered in a dry place, pecans will stay fresh for 5 days.
