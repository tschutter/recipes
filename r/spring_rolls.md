Spring Rolls
------------

- 4 ounces vermicelli rice noodles
- 1 4.7-ounce package Vietnamese spring roll wrappers (at least 16)
- 2 large carrots, cut into matchsticks (about 1 c.)
- 1/2 English cucumber, thinly sliced (about 1 c.)
- 1 mango, thinly sliced
- 6 green onions, thinly sliced
- 2 cups fresh tender herbs (such as basil, cilantro, and/or mint)
- 1/2 pound cooked medium shrimp or chicken
- sweet chili sauce, for serving
<!-- -->
- 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/4 cup hot water
- 2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoon honey
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- chopped roasted peanuts, for serving

Prepare the vermicelli according to the package directions.

Chop the protein into bite-size pieces.

Fill a pie dish or a wide, shallow bowl with warm water.  Working with
1 spring roll wrapper at a time, dip a wrapper in the water for a few
seconds until softened.  Place the softened wrapper on a damp cutting
board.  Working on the bottom third of the wrapper, layer on a small
amount of noodles, carrot, cucumber, mango, green onion, and herbs.
Place 3 to 4 pieces of the protein on top of the vegetables.  Fold the
bottom of the wrapper up over the fillings, fold the corners of the
wrapper in, and tightly roll the spring rolls.  Place the finished
rolls on a serving platter and cover with a damp paper towel.  Repeat
with the remaining ingredients.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, hot water, lime
juice, honey, hot sauce, sesame oil, soy sauce, and garlic until well
combined.  Transfer to a serving bowl and top with chopped peanuts.

Serve the spring rolls with the peanut sauce and sweet chili sauce.
