Currant-Ginger Shortbread
-------------------------

- 8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- pinch of salt
- 1/3 cup dried currants
- 1 packed tablespoon finely diced crystallized ginger
  -or maybe-
- 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger

If the currants are very dry, steam them for 10 minutes.

In a mixer, cream together the butter and sugar at medium speed until
light and smooth, about 3 minutes.  Add flour, salt, currants, and
ginger, and mix until well blended, about 3 minutes.  Gather dough
into a ball and flatten slightly.

Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper (or use a nonstick baking
mat).  Place dough on paper or mat and roll out into a 10 inch square,
an even 1/4 inch thick.  Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and
refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line two cookie sheets with parchment
paper.  Using a sharp knife, cut dough into 10 1 inch wide strips.
Cut each strip into 1-1/2 inch long rectangles.  Gather and roll out
scraps and cut out more cookies.

One sheet at a time, bake until edges are lightly golden, 12 to 15
minutes.  Cool on sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack and cool
completely before storing in an airthight container up to 1 week.
