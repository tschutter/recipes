Vegetarian Stuffed Acorn Squash
-------------------------------

- 2 medium acorn squash
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, divided
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 1 cup water
<!-- -->
- 1/4 cup dried tart cherries
<!-- -->
- 1/4 cup raw pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)
<!-- -->
- 1/4 cup chopped green onion
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish
- 1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese or feta

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a large, rimmed baking
sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up.

Slice each squash in half from the tip to the stem.  Use a large spoon
to scoop out the seeds and stringy bits inside, and discard those
pieces.

Place the squash halves cut side up on the parchment-lined
pan. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over the squash, and
sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Rub the oil into the cut sides
of the squash, then turn them over so the cut sides are against the
pan.  Bake until the squash flesh is easily pierced through by a fork,
about 30 to 45 minutes.  Leave the oven on.

Meanwhile, cook the quinoa.  In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed
quinoa and water.  Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat,
then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.
Simmer, uncovered, until all of the water is absorbed, 12 to 18
minutes.  Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cherries.
Cover, and let the mixture steam for 5 minutes.  Uncover and fluff the
quinoa with a fork.

In a medium skillet, toast the pepitas over medium heat, stirring
frequently, until the pepitas are turning golden on the edges and
making little popping noises, about 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside.

Pour the fluffed quinoa mixture into a medium mixing bowl.  Add the
toasted pepitas, chopped green onion, parsley, garlic, lemon juice,
the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive
oil.  Stir until the ingredients are evenly distributed.  Taste and
add additional salt, if necessary.

If the mixture is very hot, let it cool for a few minutes before
adding the Parmesan cheese and goat cheese.  Gently stir the mixture
to combine.

Turn the cooked squash halves over so the cut sides are facing up.
Divide the mixture evenly between the squash halves with a large
spoon.  Return the squash to the oven and bake for 15 to 18 minutes,
until the cheesy quinoa is turning golden on top.

Sprinkle the stuffed squash with the remaining 1 tablespoon chopped
parsley, and serve warm.
