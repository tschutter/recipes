Hogback Pork Chops
------------------

- 8 pork chops, 3/4 inch thick
- 1/2 cup apple juice
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 3 large red apples
- 1/2 cup water

Brown chops in a greased skillet over medium heat.  Arrange chops in a
shallow 2-quart baking dish.  Pour apple juice over chops and sprinkle
with raisins and salt.  Cover and bake at 350 degrees F for 45
minutes.

Core apples and cut each into 6-8 wedges.  Combine brown sugar, nutmeg

remaining sugar mixture and pour water over all.  Cover and bake an
additional 15 minutes.
