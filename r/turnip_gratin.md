Turnip Gratin
-------------

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 bunch small turnips, trimmed and sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme or generous pinch dry
- salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup cream
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Melt the butter in a skillet and swirl to completely cover the bottom
of the pan.  Layer the turnip slices into the pan, sprinkling each
layer with the salt, pepper, and spices.  Cook for a few minutes over
medium heat until they start to sizzle.

Combine the cream and stock together and pour over the turnip slices.
Cover and cook over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes, until the
turnips are mostly cooked through.

Remove the cover and continue to simmer to reduce the liquid.  When
most of the liquid has reduced (another 5-10 minutes), and the sauce
is thickened, sprinkle the Parmesan evenly over the top.  Serve hot.
