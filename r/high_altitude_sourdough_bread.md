High Altitude Sourdough Bread
-----------------------------

- 50 grams sourdough starter
- 100 grams warm water
- 100 grams bread flour
<!-- -->
- 650 grams warm water
- 800 grams bread flour
- 100 grams whole wheat flour
<!-- -->
- 20 grams salt
- 50 grams warm water

*Activate Preferment (overnight)*

Mix the sourdough starter with 100 grams of warm water and 100 grams
of bread flour to create the the preferment (levain).  Cover and leave
on the counter overnight.  If the environment is cold and/or dry, then
keep the preferment in the microwave with a small bowl of boiled
water.

*Make Dough (10 minutes)*

In a large pot, combine the preferment with 600 grams of warm water.
Using your hand, incorporate the preferment a bit by squeezing it
through your fingers.

Add 800 grams of bread flour and 100 grams of whole wheat flour.  Mix
just until all the flour has been hydrated. Cover with plastic.

*Autolyse (30 minutes)*

Let the dough rest 30 minutes.  This rest is called the autolyse
("auto-lease"), which allows the flours to absorb the water,
activating the enzymes which begins the gluten development. This step
is critical and cannot be rushed.

*Incorporate Salt (5 minutes)*

Sprinkle 20 grams of salt over the dough and then add 50 grams of warm
water.  Poke your fingers into the dough to press some salt deep
inside, then fold over itself about a dozen times or so to incorporate
the salt. Cover the bowl again; the bulk fermentation has begun.  If
the environment is cold and/or dry, then keep the bowl in the
microwave with a small bowl of boiled water.

*Bulk Fermentation (~4 hours)*

During the first two hours stretch-and-fold the dough every 20
minutes.  For each stretch-and-fold, first wet your hand to prevent
excessive sticking.  Then reach under the dough, grab the bottom and
pull up the dough up as far as possible, and then turn it back on top
of itself.  Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 3 more times.
Recover the bowl.  If the environment is cold and/or dry, re-boil the
water before putting the dough back in the microwave.

If your dough does not seem very elastic, you can repeat the
stretch-and-fold process two more times, with a thirty-minute rest in
between each. If the dough becomes difficult to stretch and does not
want to bounce back, let it rest.  You will know the dough is properly
fermented when it has grown by about 30 percent, has a few nice big
bubbles on the surface, and a slightly shiny appearance.

For the final two hours, just let the dough rest.  Bulk fermentation
is complete when the dough has doubled in size.

*Divide and Pre-shape (10 minutes)*

Take the dough out of the container onto your unfloured work surface.
Sprinkle some flour on top of your dough and divide in two equal
halves.  Take a half, flip it over and pull each of 4 edges from under
onto the top.  Flip the folded dough over so the seam is on the
unfloured work surface.  The work surface grabs the bottom of the
dough slightly as you form the boule (ball).  Place your fingers on
the lower back side of the boule and pull it a few inches towards you.
Rotate the boule and repeat until the loose boule is formed with a
taught, smooth surface.  Be careful to do this process gently so as
not to release the gases that have allowed the dough to rise.  Repeat
with the other half.

*Bench Rest (30 minutes)*

Cover the boules with tea towels or inverted mixing bowls.  Let rest
for 30 minutes.

*Shape (10 minutes)*

Prepare the final proofing containers: either banneton baskets or
medium bowls lined with a clean kitchen towel and sprinkled very
liberally with flour.

The resting dough should have spread out, but not quite into a pancake
shape. If it has formed a pancake you can strengthen it by pre-shaping
one more time and waiting another 20-30 minutes.

Repeat the shaping process and place each boule upside down (smooth
side down, seam side up) in a proofing container.

*Proof (2-12 hours)*

If baking immediately, allow the dough to prove at room temperature
for two hours, or until it slowly springs back when poked.  If time
allows, proof in the fridge for 8-12 hours.  This allows the gluten to
develop further and results in much better flavor.

*Final Prep (1 hour)*

Place a dutch oven (or pizza stone, if no dutch oven is available)
inside the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F for 1 hour.  If using a
dutch oven, place it on top of a baking sheet to help prevent a burned
bottom crust.

If the dough has proved overnight in the fridge, remove and allow to
rest at room temperature while the oven is heating.  Test the dough.
You will know that it is ready to bake when you poke the dough gently
with your finger and it springs back slowly.  If it springs back very
quickly, then it needs a few more minutes.  If the indentation stays,
then it has over-proved and should be baked immediately.

Turn the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, seam side down.  Using
a very sharp knife or razor blade, quickly and carefully score the
bread in a decorative pattern. The key is to allow the bread a way to
expand while baking so it does not split.

*Bake (1 hour)*

Spritz or sprinkle the dough with water to help create steam for a
crisp, crackly crust.

If using a dutch oven, transfer the dough still on its parchment into
the dutch oven.  Replace the dutch oven lid, return to the oven, and
bake for 25 minutes.  Then remove the lid, and bake 20-25 minutes
more until loaf is deep brown.

If baking on a sheet or pizza stone, bake uncovered for 40 minutes
until the crust is deep and dark.

*Cool (1 hour)*

Cool on a baking rack, avoiding slicing until the loaf is thoroughly
cooled, about an hour.  The loaf can be left out at room temperature
for one day; after that, wrap it in plastic and place inside a
zippered plastic bag.
