Spaghetti alla Carbonara
------------------------

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 4 ounces bacon
<!-- -->
- 1 pound spaghetti
<!-- -->
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
<!-- -->
- 3 tablespoons heavy cream

Cut bacon crosswise into small strips.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the
butter in a skillet.  Add bacon and cook.  Remove pan from heat.

Start cooking spaghetti.

In a bowl, beat eggs and 1/2 cup of cheese with a fork until well
blended.  Add salt and pepper.

Place spaghetti in a large bowl and add remaining butter.  Toss until
butter is melted.  Mix in egg mixture.  The goal is to cook the egg
without making scrambled eggs.  Stir in bacon mixture and cream and
blend.

Serve with remaining cheese.
