Easy Chuck Roast
----------------

- 3-4 pound chuck roast
<!-- -->
- salt and pepper
- 1 teaspoon basil
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon rosemary
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
<!-- -->
- 2 onions
- 1.5 cups water or broth
<!-- -->
- 1 pound carrots, peeled and chopped
- 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped

Marinate in spices at least 10 minutes, though several hours is
better.

Brown meat on all sides in a skillet on medium-high heat to lock in
juices. (optional step that enhances flavor)

Place roast along with sliced onions and 1-1.5 cups of water or beef
broth in a crock pot.

After two hours, add carrots and sweet potatoes to crock pot. They can
be added at the beginning but they will be much softer at the end.

Cook for 4 hours in the crock pot on low.

Let sit 10 minutes before cutting. Slice against the grain.
