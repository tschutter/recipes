New Mexican Green Chili
-----------------------

- 4 to 4 1/2 pounds natural pork butt or pork shoulder roast
- 2 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 1/2 pounds whole, fresh, roasted green chiles
- 3 large whole white onions, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 8 cups chicken stock
- 2 cups canned, whole peeled tomatoes, coarsely chopped
- 2 teaspoons salt or to taste
- 1 cup fresh cilantro leaves

Trim the pork of fat and set two large 3 to 4 inch pieces of white
pork fat aside to use later.  Cut pork into 1 inch cubes.  Place
flour, salt, and black pepper in a bag and mix well.  Add the cubes of
pork.  Shake the pork cubes in the flour mixture until meat is well
covered.

Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in large stockpot.  Add chopped
onions and garlic and cook for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, but be
sure to allow onion to brown slightly.

NOTE: Try cooking pork in batches.  All at once ended up with black
char layer on the bottom of the pot.

Add dredged pork cubes, the reserved two pieces of pork fat and stir
with onion and garlic.  Allow the pork to brown, cooking for up to 15
to 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until pork cubes are seared on all
sides and bottom of pan has nice amount of brown bits from the pork
and onion.

Remove cooked large pieces of fat and discard.

Add chicken stock, green chile (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups of chopped
chile) and chopped canned tomatoes.  With a wooden spoon, gently
scrape bottom and sides of pan to help flavor the stock.  With no lid
on the stockpot, allow chile to come to a boil and then reduce heat to
a light simmer.  Simmer for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until pork is
tender.  Salt to taste.  The green chile should be rich and brown in
color.

Just before serving add fresh cilantro to chili.
