Sourdough Pizza Dough
---------------------

- 300 grams all-purpose flour
- 210 grams warm water
<!-- -->
- 50 grams sourdough starter (100% hydration)
- 6 grams salt
- 20 grams olive oil (optional)

*Autolyse (60 minutes)*

In a large pot, combine 300 grams of all-purpose flour and 210 grams
of warm water.  Mix just until all the flour has been hydrated. Cover
and let the flours rest at least 60 minutes.

*Make Dough (10 minutes)*

Add the starter to the dough.  Incorporate the starter by squeezing it
through your fingers.

Oil is not part of the original Italian dough recipe, but this is
because Italian pizzas are cooked in open wood ovens at a higher
temperature (700 degrees F).  Therefore the cooking is faster (4
minutes), so the dough doesn't have time to dry up. Humidity is indeed
a key factor for dough softness and taste.  When cooking at 500
degrees F, a bit of oil can preserve the dough from drying up.

Sprinkle 6 grams of salt (and 20 grams of olive oil if necessary) over
the dough.  Poke your fingers into the dough to press some salt (and
oil) deep inside, then fold over itself about a dozen times or so to
incorporate the salt (and oil).

Knead for 2 minutes.  Cover the bowl again; the bulk fermentation has
begun.  If the environment is cold and/or dry, then keep the bowl in
the microwave with a small bowl of boiled water.

*Bulk Fermentation (~4 hours)*

During the first two hours stretch-and-fold the dough every 20
minutes.  For each stretch-and-fold, first wet your hand to prevent
excessive sticking.  Then reach under the dough, grab the bottom and
pull up the dough up as far as possible, and then turn it back on top
of itself.  Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat 7 more times.
Recover the bowl.  If the environment is cold and/or dry, re-boil the
water before putting the dough back in the microwave.

If your dough does not seem very elastic, you can repeat the
stretch-and-fold process two more times, with a thirty-minute rest in
between each. If the dough becomes difficult to stretch and does not
want to bounce back, let it rest.

For the final two hours, just let the dough rest.  Bulk fermentation
is complete when the dough has doubled in size, has a few nice big
bubbles on the surface, and a slightly shiny appearance.

*Proof (2 hours or overnight)*

If baking immediately, allow the dough to prove at room temperature
for two hours, or until it slowly springs back when poked.  If time
allows, proof in the fridge for 8-12 hours.  This allows the gluten to
develop further and results in much better flavor.

*Preheat*

Preheat oven (and pizza stone if using) to 500 degrees F for 1 hour.

*Divide and Shape (10 minutes)*

Take the dough out of the container onto your unfloured work surface.
Sprinkle some flour on top of your dough and divide in two equal
halves.  Take a half, flip it over and pull each of 4 edges from under
onto the top.  Flip the folded dough over so the seam is on the
unfloured work surface.  The work surface grabs the bottom of the
dough slightly as you form the boule (ball).  Place your fingers on
the lower back side of the boule and pull it a few inches towards you.
Rotate the boule and repeat until the loose boule is formed with a
taught, smooth surface.  Be careful to do this process gently so as
not to release the gases that have allowed the dough to rise.  Repeat
with the other half.

Stretch each boule into a 12 inch pizza.  Do not use a rolling pin!
Sprinkle a pizza peel with cornmeal and place pizza dough on the peel.
Cover with pizza ingredients.  Bake for as long as necessary.

*Notes*

This recipe contains 325 grams of flour and 235 grams of water which
results in 72% hydration.  This assumes that the starter is at 100%
hydration.
