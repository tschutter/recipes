Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter Ice Cream
---------------------------------------------

- 24 ounces Boulder Beer Shake Chocolate Porter
- 4 cups heavy cream
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 12 ounces dark chocolate chips
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1.5 cups sugar
- pinch of kosher salt
- 10 large egg yolks
- 2 cups peanut butter, divided

In a medium skillet, heat 1/2 of the beer over medium heat and simmer
until reduced by half (about 10 minutes).

In a medium saucepan, warm 2 cups of the cream and whisk in the cocoa
powder until dissolved.  Bring to boil, then reduce the heat and
simmer at a low boil for 30 seconds, whisking constantly.  Remove from
heat and add the chocolate, stirring until smooth.  Stir in the
remaining cream, porter, and vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture into a
large bowl.

Warm the milk, sugar, and salt in the saucepan.  In a separate medium
bowl, whisk together the egg yolks.  Slowly pour the warm milk into
the egg yolks while whisking constantly so that you do not cook the
egg yolks.

Stir the mixture constantly over medium heat, scraping the bottom as
you stir, until the mixture thickens into custard and coats the back
of the spoon.  The custard can quickly begin to curdle if it reaches
temperatures over 170 degrees F, so it is best to check the
temperature with a thermometer.  Pour the custard into the chocolate
and beer mixture until smooth, then stir in one quarter of the peanut
butter until completely incorporated.

Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator (at least 4 hours or
preferably overnight).

Freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's
instructions.  Swirl in the remaining peanut butter and freeze
overnight or until solid.
