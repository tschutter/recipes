- 1-1/2 pounds jumbo shrimp, shelled and deveined

- 2 tablespoons butter

Season the shrimp with salt and pepper.  Melt butter in a large
skillet over medium heat.  Raise the heat to high, and add shrimp.
Cook the shrimp, without moving them, for 1 minute.  Add the garlic
and cook for 1 minute.  Turn the shrimp over and cook for 2 minutes
more.  Transfer the shrimp to a bowl.

Return the skillet to the heat and pour in the wine and lemon juice.
Boil the liquid until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds.  Scrape up
any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.  Stir
in Italian seasoning.  Optionally add red-pepper flakes or a few
dashes of hot pepper sauce.  Pour the sauce over the shrimp, season
with salt and pepper to taste and toss to combine.

Serve over angel hair pasta and top with grated parmesan cheese.
