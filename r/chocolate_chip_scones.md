Chocolate Chip Scones
---------------------

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons sugar
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup vegetable shortening
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Heat oven to 425 degrees F.  Grease baking sheet.

In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in shortening until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs.

In a small bowl, combine milk, egg, and vanilla.  Add to dry
ingredients along with chocolate chips.  Mix with fork until mixture
clings together and forms a soft dough.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 5 or 6
times.  With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll one half of dough
into a 7-inch round.  Cut into 4 wedges.

Place scones 1 inch apart on greased baking sheet.  Pierce tops with
tines of fork.

Bake scones for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Serve warm.
