Brown Sugar Cherry Cakes
------------------------

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
- 2/3 cup packed light-brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons low-fat buttermilk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
<!-- -->
- 60 cherries (about 11 ounces), pitted
- 2 tablespoons light-brown sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 12-cup standard nonstick
muffin tin. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and
salt; set aside.

With an electric mixer, cream butter and 2/3 cup brown sugar until
smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a
time; beat until combined. Beat in buttermilk and vanilla, then flour
mixture.

Spoon batter into prepared tin, filling cups about 1/3 full. Place 5
cherries on top of each; sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.

Bake until cakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in tin. Run a
knife around edges; turn out of pan, cherry sides up. Serve warm, with
ice cream, if desired.
