Salade Canaille (Yummy Salad with Pears and Walnuts)
----------------------------------------------------

- 1-1/2 tablespoons mild white wine vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2-1/2 tablespoons light salad oil
- 1 tablespoon walnut oil
- 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
- 1 teaspoon fine grated orange rind
- 1-1/2 small shallots, minced finely
<!-- -->
- 4 to 5 cups mixed greens (10 oz bag)
- 1 bartlett pear, cut thinly.
- 1/2 cup walnuts

In a mixing bowl, dissolve salt in the vinegar; then beat in the salad
oil and the walnut oil.  Add pepper, orange rind, and shallots.

Pour on top of greens, and toss together.  Add cut pear to the top,
along with 1/2 cup walnuts.  Or, serve the walnuts on the side.

Of course, you can create individual salads, and place the pears and
walnuts individually.
