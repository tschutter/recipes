Shrimp and Pesto Calzones
-------------------------

- 1 10 ounce package refigerated pizza dough
- 3 tablespoons pesto
- 6 ounce package frozen, peeled, and cooked small shrimp, thawed
- 3 thin tomato slices
- 3 ounces fontina or mozzarella cheese, shredded (3/4 cup)
- 1 beaten egg white

Divide pizza dough into 3 pieces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll
each piece of dough into a 6 inch circle.  Spread 1 tablespoon of
pesto on top of half of each circle to within 1 inch of the edges.
Top pesto with 1/3 of the shrimp, 1 tomato slice, and 1/3 of the
cheese.

Moisten edges of dough on each circle with egg white.  Fold each
circle in half.  Seal edges with the tines of a fork to prevent
filling from oozing out while baking.  Prick tops once or twice.
Brush with remaining egg white.

Baked on a greased baking sheet with a lip in a 375 degree F oven for
20-25 minutes or until golden.
