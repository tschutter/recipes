Creamy Zucchini Pasta
---------------------

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 3 cups diced zucchini, from (2-3 medium)
- 2 small shallots, sliced (about 1 cup)
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 20 basil leaves
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground
- 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 pound long pasta such as spaghetti, fusilli, or bucatini
- 1/2 cup pasta water

In a medium sized saucepan heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add the
zucchini and shallots and cook until softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Add garlic and cook for another minute.

Once vegetables are very soft, add heavy cream, basil leaves, salt,
pepper and parmesan cheese. Bring to a gentle simmer and allow to cook
for 5 minutes, stir until all ingredients are incorporated.

While the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta in salted water according
to package instructions. When draining the pasta, be sure to reserve
1/2 cup of pasta water.

Add pasta water to zucchini sauce. Using either a hand held immersion
blender or a high speed blender, blend the sauce until mostly
smooth. Adjust salt as needed.

Toss sauce with pasta and serve topped with more parmesan and freshly
ground pepper.
