Corn with Chipotle and Thyme
----------------------------

- 1/2 cup butter
- 3 shallots, chopped
- 1 tablespoon canned chipotle chiles, finely chopped (maybe more)
<!-- -->
- 3 packages frozen petite white corn kernels, thawed and well drained
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- salt and freshly ground pepper
- fresh thyme sprigs, optional

In a large, heavy frying pan melt the butter over medium heat.  When
hot, add the shallots and saute, stirring until tender, about 2
minutes. Add the chiles and stir for 30 seconds longer.

Add the corn and chopped or dried thyme and cook, stirring frequently,
until tender, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper
and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Garnish with thyme sprigs, if
desired, and serve at once.
