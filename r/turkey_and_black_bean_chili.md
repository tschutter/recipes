- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 onion, peeled and chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 1 red bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely diced
- 1 green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely diced
- 1-1/2 pounds ground turkey
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons cocoa powder
- 3/4 to 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper, depending on desired strength
- 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar (or white wine vinegar with 1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves)
- 2 tablespoons strong brewed coffee
- 2 14 ounce cans crushed fire roasted plum tomatoes
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups cooked black beans

Heat oil over medium-high heat in deep pot with a thick bottom or
dutch oven.  Add the onions, garlic and peppers.  Saute, stirring
frequently, for 5 minutes.  Add the ground turkey and saute for 5
minutes, stirring constantly and breaking up any lumps with a spoon.

Stir in the flour, chil powder, cumin and cocoa.  Cook over low heat,
stirring frequently, for 3 minutes to cook the spices.

Add cayenne pepper, tarragon vinegar, coffee, tomatoes, and salt.
Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Simmer the chili, stirring
occasionally, for 40-45 minutes, until thick and turkey is tender.

Add the black beans and cook for 5 additional minutes.

Note: The chili can be made up to three days in advance and
refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap.  It can also be
frozen for up to a month.  Good to double and save half in freezer.
