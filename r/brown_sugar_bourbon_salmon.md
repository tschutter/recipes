Brown Sugar and Bourbon Salmon
------------------------------

- 1-1/2 pound skinless salmon fillet
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup bourbon
- 1/2 cup chopped scallions, green parts only
- 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons dark sesame oil

Mix marinade ingredients in a gallon zip-lock bag.  Put the salmon in
the bag and refrigerate for 1 to 8 hours.

Place salmon without the marinade in a 9-by-13 inch glass baking dish
and bake at 425 degrees for about 13 minutes.  Put the reserved
marinade in a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat.

WARNING!  Baking with the marinade resulted in a fireball exploding
out of the oven due to the evaporated alcohol!

Serve over rice, spooning the marinade over the salmon.
