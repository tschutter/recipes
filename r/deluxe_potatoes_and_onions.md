Deluxe Potatoes and Onions
--------------------------

- 1/2 pound bacon
- 1 large potato per person
- 1/2 onion per person
- salt and pepper

Cut up bacon into pieces.  Cook until half done.

Slice potatoes in even slices about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut onions in
sixths or eights.

Put in potatoes and onions, salt and pepper more than you think is
enough, then cover and apply heat to top also so they can brown on the
top and bottom at the same time.

Check them every 10 to 15 minutes.  Turn with a spatula to rotate
them.  Add more oil if needed, a little at a time, so as not to get
too oily.  Cook until tender to fork, about 45 minutes.
