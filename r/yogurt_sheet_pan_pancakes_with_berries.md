Cover the entire pan with a piece of parchment paper.  Spray oil on
the parchment paper.

flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In another medium bowl, combine yogurt, milk, water, eggs, butter, and
vanilla extract.

Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet.  Spread the batter
evenly with a spatula then tap the sheet pan on the counter a couple
of times to settle the batter.
