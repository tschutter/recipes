Buckeye Candy
-------------

- 1 1/2 pounds powdered sugar
- 1 pound chunky peanut butter
- 1/2 pound butter
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 12 ounce package chocolate chips
- 1/4 bar paraffin

Combine powdered sugar, peanut butter, butter and vanilla until
dough-like consistency.  Knead until all sugar is blended throughly.
Form into balls the size of a small buckeye.

In a double boiler melt chocolate chips with the parffin.  Using a
toothpick in the top of the candy ball, dip into chocolate leaving the
top uncovered to look like a buckeye.

Place balls on waxpaper on a cookie sheet as you make them and put
back on waxpaper after they are dipped.
