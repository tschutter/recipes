Southwest Shoofly Pie
---------------------

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup solid shortening
- 1 cup light molasses
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup boiling water

Combine flour, sugar and shortening.  Blend with a pastry knife, or
quickly in a food processor, until crumbly like oatmeal.  Place the
crumbly mixture in a greased pie pan, and spread evenly on the bottom
and up the sides, being careful not to compress the mix.

Blend molasses, baking soda, and boiling water; carefully pour over
the crumbs.

Bake for 45 minutes.

Sides will be slightly puffy when done.  Cool before serving and slice
like pie.  If the pie breaks apart, or you desire variety, scoop it
out and serve in a dish topped with whipped cream.  No one will ever
know the difference.
