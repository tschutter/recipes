Fire Roasted Sweet Corn Salsa
-----------------------------

- 4 ears sweet corn, in husk
- 1/2 cup red onion, diced fine
- 1/2 cup green onion, diced fine
- 1/2 cup sweet red bell pepper, diced fine
- 1/2 cup jicama, diced fine
- 1/8 cup jalapeno pepper, stemmed and seeded, diced fine
- 1/8 cup cilantro, minced
- 2 limes, juice only

Prepare corn for roasting by pulling down husks, removing the silk,
and pulling the husks back up.  Soak in cold water for 10 to 15
minutes before grilling.

Roast corn in husk over the grill, 10-15 minutes. Let cool. When
cooled, cut corn from the cob and combine with remaining
ingredients. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours to blend flavors. Can be
served cold or warm.
