Spatchcocked Turkey
-------------------

- 1 onion
- 2 stalks celery
- 1 apple
- 2 carrots
- 1 turnip
- 1 parsnip
- sage
- thyme
- rosemary
- parsley
- fennel

Place the bird on its breast and locate the spine.  On either side of
the backbone cut down the length of the spine using kitchen shears.
Snip through the ribs about 1/2 inch to an inch away from the spine.
Remove the back bone.

Flip the bird over so that the breast is facing up.  Press down hard
on the breast to break the bones on the rib cage so the bird will lie
flatter.

Dice vegetables and scatter on a sheet pan.  Add herbs.

Place the bird on the vegetables and arrange the legs so that they lie
as flat as possible on the pan without breaking the joints in the leg
or tearing the skin. Tuck the wings under the rib cage to protect them
as they cook.

Roast for 20 minutes at 450 degrees F.  Reduce temperature to 400
degrees F and continue roasting until the deepest part of the breast
reaches 159 degrees F.  A 20 pound bird takes about 90 minutes.
