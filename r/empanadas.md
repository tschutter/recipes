Empanadas
---------

- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 16 ounce bag frozen corn
- 1/2 cup chopped onions
- 8 ounces grated cheddar cheese
- 1 cup salsa
<!-- -->
- 2 16 ounce cans large refrigerated biscuits

Brown the ground beef in a frying pan with the garlic.  Add salt and
pepper.  Remove from heat and let cool.

In a large bowl, mix the corn, onions, cheese, and salsa.  Add the
cooled beef, mixing carefully so not to break up all of the cheese.

Roll the biscuits out flat on a floured surface to about 2-1/2 times
their original diameter.

Place about 1/3 cup filling on one side of the circle.  Fold the dough
over the filling like a turnover, and crimp the edges with a fork.

Place on lightly greased cookie sheet and bake at 375 degrees F until
lightly browned, about 12 minutes.
