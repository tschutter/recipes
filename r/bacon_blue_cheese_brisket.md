Bacon Blue Cheese Brisket
-------------------------

- 1 pound thick-cut bacon, divided

- 2 large sweet onions

- salt and pepper
- 3-1/2 pounds flat-cut boneless beef brisket

- 3 cups water
- 4 teaspoons beef bouillon
- 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper

- 6 ounces crumbled blue cheese

In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until it is flexible
but not crispy.  Remove half of the bacon and cook the rest until
crispy.  Remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate, keeping the
two halves separate.  Chop into bite-size pieces.  The soft bacon will
be cooked with the brisket, and the crispy bacon will be sprinkled on
top just before serving.  Leave the bacon drippings in the skillet.

Slice the onions into half or quarter inch rings and place them in the
bottom of a large slow cooker.

Generously salt and pepper the brisket.  Turn up the heat on the
skillet to medium high and add the brisket.  Brown for about 2 minutes
each side.  Place the brisket on top of the onions.

Discard the leftover bacon grease.  Add the water and bouillon to the
hot skillet and stir up the browned bits.  When the bouillon is
dissolved, pour the broth into the slow cooker.

Sprinkle with additional cracked pepper and the soft bacon.

Cover and cook on high heat for 5-7 hours or low for 9-10 hours, or
until the meat is fall-apart tender.

Serve the brisket sprinkled with the crispy bacon and blue cheese.
Serve with crusty bread to dip in the broth.
