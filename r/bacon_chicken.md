Bacon Chicken
-------------

- 6 slices bacon
<!-- -->
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
<!-- -->
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon pepper
<!-- -->
- 1-1/2 cups shredded cheddar or colby cheese

Cut bacon into 1" pieces.  Cook bacon in 12" skillet until crisp,
about 4-6 minutes.  Crumble bacon and set aside.  Pour bacon grease
out of skillet, but don't wash or wipe the skillet.

Cut chicken breasts so that no piece is more than 1" thick.

Add butter and olive oil to skillet.  Saute chicken breasts in this
mixture over medium heat, turning once, until chicken is almost cooked
and just barely pink in center.  The internal temperature should be
150 degrees F.  This should take 8-10 minutes.  Place chicken in
ungreased 12x8" baking dish.

Cook onion and garlic in drippings remaining in skillet.  Cook until
onion is softened, then stir in salt, pepper, and cooked bacon.

Spoon over chicken breasts and sprinkle with cheese.  Bake at 350
degrees for 10-15 minutes or until chicken is thoroughly cooked to 160
degrees F and cheese is melted.
