Dutch Oven Chicken
------------------

- 1 chicken
flour
seasoning
oil

Preheat 3 cups of water.

Skin and wash chicken parts. Using too much seasoning, put seasonings
and flour in a paper sack, add chicken parts and shake to coat.

Add approximately 1/2 inch of oil in the bottom of the dutch oven.
Completely brown chicken parts.  Remove from oven and drain off excess
oil.

Place chicken back in the dutch oven and add approximately 1/4 inch of
warm water.  Cover and place on a small bed of coals and steam for
approximately 1 hour or until tender.  Make sure there is always a
small amount of moisture in the dutch oven.
