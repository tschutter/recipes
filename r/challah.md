Challah
-------

- 1-1/2 tablespoons (2 packets) active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup warm water
<!-- -->
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->
- 850 g flour
<!-- -->
- 1-1/2 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)

In a small bowl mix yeast, sugar, and warm water.  Yeast grows best if
the water temperature is between 100 to 110 degrees F.  Let sit for 10
minutes until bubbly.

In a larger bowl mix eggs, oil, honey, water, salt.  Add yeast
mixture.  (I add a touch of oj in here too).  Mix well.

Add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides.

Take the dough out of bowl and plop it on a big pile of flour, knead
it all well, until not too sticky and not too dry.

Optionally, you can add the chocolate chips at this time.

Put in bowl, cover with towel and let rise in a warm place for 1-1/2
hours, until nearly double.

Pound it down, braid it up, put your prayers in too!

Place on a greased cookie sheet.  Cover and let rise for 1/2 hour.

Bake at 350 degrees F for 22 minutes.
