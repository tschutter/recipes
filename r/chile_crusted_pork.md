Chile Crusted Pork
------------------

- 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons dark chili powder
- 3 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons dried onion flakes
- 1-1/2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1-1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
<!-- -->
- 1 bone-in pork butt shoulder roast, about 9 pounds
<!-- -->
- 2 cups chicken broth

Mix brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, onion flakes, garlic powder,
salt, black pepper, and dry mustard in a small bowl.  Spice rub can be
made up to a week in advance.  This recipe make a cup; you will need
about 3/4 cup for the pork.

Place a wire rack in a deep roasting pan.  Pat pork roast dry.  Cut
four 1/2 inch deep slits evenly spaced on both sides of the roast.
Set roast on the rack in the pan, fat side down.  Coat heavily with
some of the spice rub.  Turn roast fat side up.  Coat sides and top
with the spice rub.  Roast can be refrigerated uncovered overnight.

Heat oven to 250 degrees F.  Place the pan with the pork in the oven.
Pour 2 cups water into the pan, but not on the roast.  Roast until a
meat thermometer registers 170 degrees F and a fork inserted in
several spots is easily removed, which will take 10 to 11 hours.  Add
more water to the pan as needed.

Transfer the roast to a cutting board.  Allow the meat to rest, tented
with foil, about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile set the roasting pan over medium heat and stir in the
chicken broth.  Heat to a boil and cook to reduce the juices slightly.
Season to taste with salt and some of the remaining spice rub if
desired.

Slice the pork very thinly.  Serve hot, drizzled with some of the pan
juices.
