Pineapple Pork Chops
--------------------

- 14 ounces crushed pineapple, undrained
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 1/4 cup white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
<!-- -->
- 4 pork chops, bone-in (about 1-1/4 pounds)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 dash black pepper
- 1/2 cup flour
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Mix pineapple, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, and
Worcestershire sauce in a bowl.

Season the pork chops with salt and pepper.  Put the flour in a
plastic bag.  Put the chops one by one into the bag and shake to
thoroughly coat the chops.

In a large skillet, heat oil at medium-high heat.  Add pork chops and
brown chops for two minutes on each side.

Pour mixture over the pork chops.  Cover and cook at low heat for 8
minutes or until pork chops are slightly pink inside.  If the sauce is
too thick, add a little bit of water.
