High-Protein Oatmeal
--------------------

- 1/2 tablespoon coconut oil
<!-- -->
- 1 cup steel-cut oats
- 1/4 cup hemp seeds
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1/4 cup flaxseed meal
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
<!-- -->
- 1-3/4 cups unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 3 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 tablespoons real maple syrup or organic or local honey
<!-- -->
- 2 large apples, cored and chopped

Grease a slow cooker with coconut oil, butter, or an oil spray.

Blend oats, hemp seeds, chia seeds, and cinnamon in a bowl.  This
prevents the chia seeds and cinnamon from clumping.  Place in the slow
cooker.

Add milk, water, salt, brown sugar, coconut oil, and maple syrup to
the slow cooker.  Cover.  Cook on low for 2 hours, stirring every half
hour.

Add chopped apple to the cooker.  Cook on low for another 2 hours,
stirring every 20 minutes.
