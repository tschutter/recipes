Chicken Marsala
---------------

- 4 tablespoons butter
- 4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts
<!-- -->
- 4 shallots, finely chopped
- 1 pound mushrooms, sliced
- 1/4 cup dry Marsala
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- salt
- freshly ground pepper

Butterfly cut the chicken breasts.  Then pound with a 2-cup glass
measuring cup until 1/4-inch thick.

In a large frying pan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium
heat.  Add chicken and saute, turning once, until lightly browned,
about 2 minutes on each side.  Remove and set aside.

Melt remaining butter in pan.  Add shallots and mushrooms.  Cook until
mushrooms are lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add Marsala and bring
to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Add cream and lemon juice and return to a boil.  Season with salt and
pepper to taste.

Return chicken to pan and cook, turning in sauce, for about 3 minutes
to reheat and finish cooking.

Serve with buttered fettuccini, rice, or bread.
