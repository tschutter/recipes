- 2 teaspoons sweet paprika
- 1-1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon salt

<!-- -->
- 2 cups long grain brown rice
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds or almonds
- 1/4 cup sunflower seeds
- 2 cups chopped onions
- 4-1/2 cups chicken stock

Combine seasoning in a small bowl.

Put large skillet over high heat and add rice and seeds.  Shake while
cooking, until seeds start to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat 5 quart pot over high heat to 350 degrees F.  Cook onions
until they start to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add seasoning mix and 1/2
cup stock, cook until the liquid is gone and the onions begin to
stick, about 4 to 5 minutes.  Stir in remaining stock.  Add rice and
seeds.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover.  Simmer until rice is
tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.
