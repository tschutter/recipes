Bison Strogenoff
----------------

- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1 pound ground bison
- 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 8 ounces sliced mushrooms
- 1 cup sour cream

Start water for noodles.

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add
onion and cook until translucent.  Add bison, mustard, salt, and
pepper and cook until almost browned.  Add mushrooms and cook until
mushrooms are reduced by half, about 3 minutes.

Immediately before serving, add sour cream and heat.  Overheating will
cause the sour cream to separate.

Serve over hot parsley noodles.
