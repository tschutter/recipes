Pulled Pork
-----------

- 2 medium yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 4 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 cup chicken broth
<!-- -->
- 1 5-pound boneless or bone-in pork shoulder (a.k.a. a pork butt)
- 4 tablespoons pork butt rub
<!-- -->
- 1 cup barbecue sauce (optional)

Place the onions and garlic in an even layer in the slow cooker and
pour in the broth.  Pat the pork dry with paper towels.  Rub the spice
mixture all over the pork and place the meat on top of the onions and
garlic.  Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily with a fork,
about 6 to 8 hours on high or 8 to 10 hours on low.

Turn off the slow cooker and remove the pork to a cutting board.  Set
a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl.  Pour the onion mixture from
the slow cooker through the strainer and return the solids to the slow
cooker.  Set the strained liquid aside.

If the pork has a bone, remove and discard it.  Using 2 forks, shred
the meat into bite-sized pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat.
Return the shredded meat to the slow cooker and mix to combine.

Use a spoon to skim and discard the fat from the surface of the
strained cooking liquid, and then add 1/4 cup of the liquid at a time
to the slow cooker until the pork is just moistened.  Taste and season
with salt as needed.
