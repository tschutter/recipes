Shrimp Skimpy Scampi
--------------------

- 3 medium zucchini
<!-- -->
- 1 large shallot (1/3 to 1/2 cup diced)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- leaves from 6 stems flat-leaf parsley
<!-- -->
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided
<!-- -->
- 1 pound shrimp, shelled and deveined
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (1/2 lemon)
<!-- -->
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper, divided
<!-- -->
- 1 cup panko

Using a cheese grater, grate the zucchini length-wise to create long,
narrow noodles.  Set aside.

Cut the shallot(s) into small dice (to yield 1/3 to 1/2 cup).  Mince
the garlic.  Coarsely chop the parsley.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease a 9-by-9-inch baking dish
or casserole with cooking oil spray.

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add
2 tablespoons of olive oil, then stir in the shallot and 1/4 teaspoon
each of the salt and black pepper.  Cook for about 3 minutes, then
stir in the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.

Meanwhile, pull off the shrimp tails, as needed.  Season the shrimp
with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and black pepper.  Add the shrimp to
the skillet and cook for 1 minute per side.

Pour in the wine and lemon juice.  Use a slotted spoon to transfer the
shrimp (which will be not quite cooked through) to a mixing bowl.

Once the liquids left in the skillet begin to bubble, add 1 tablespoon
of butter, 1 tablespoon of oil and 1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper.  Stir
until melted and saucy.  Pour over the shrimp in the bowl.

Return the empty skillet to medium heat.  Add the panko and cook,
stirring, for a few minutes or just until lightly golden.  Turn off
the heat.

Add the zucchini noodles and parsley to the bowl with the shrimp and
toss gently to coat.  Pour into the baking dish or casserole.  Top
with the lightly toasted panko and then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon lemon
pepper over the crumbs.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, just until bubbling a little at the edges.
