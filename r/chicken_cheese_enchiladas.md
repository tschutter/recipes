In a ziploc bag, combine taco seasoning mix, olive oil, and 1/4 cup

In a medium bowl, combine 2-1/2 cups of the Monterey Jack cheese,
cilantro, salt, ricotta cheese, chiles and egg.  Mix well.

Heat large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot.  Add

salsa and 1/4 cup water.  Mix well.  Spread evenly in the bottom of
the baking dish.
