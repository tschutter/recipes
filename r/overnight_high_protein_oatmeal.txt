Overnight High-Protein Oatmeal

1 tablespoon coconut oil

2 cups steel-cut oats
1/2 cup hemp seeds
1/2 cup chia seeds

3 cups unsweetened non-dairy milk
6 cups water
4 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup coconut oil
1/4 cup real maple syrup or organic or local honey

4 large apples, cored and chopped

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Grease a slow cooker with coconut oil, butter, or an oil spray.

Blend oats, hemp seeds, and chia seeds in a bowl.  This prevents the
chia seeds from clumping.  Place in the slow cooker.

Add milk, water, cinnamon, salt, brown sugar, coconut oil, and maple
syrup to the slow cooker.  Cover.  Cook on low for 3 hours, stirring
every half hour.

Add chopped apple to the cooker.  Cook on low for 1 hour, stirring
every 15 minutes.

Add vanilla before serving.
