Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Add
the onions to the melted butter and stir until translucent.

Add ground beef and fry with the onions. Add salt and black pepper to
taste.

Add the pasta and add water until it is 1/2 inch above the pasta
level.  Simmer.

In a small bowl, mix the yogurt with 2 to 3 tablespoons of salt and
