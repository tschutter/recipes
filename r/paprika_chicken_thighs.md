Paprika Chicken Thighs
----------------------

- 1 tablespoon sweet smoked paprika
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1/4 cup water
- 1-1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
<!-- -->
- 8 pieces skinless, boneless chicken thighs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt and pepper
<!-- -->
- 1/2 pound egg noodles
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large clove garlic, grated or finely chopped
- 1 shallot, finely chopped, or 1/4 cup finely chopped onion

In a small bowl, mix the paprika, tomato paste, 1/4 cup water,
Worcestershire and hot sauce.

Remove excess fat from chicken thighs.  Preheat a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Drizzle the chicken thighs with olive oil and season
with salt and pepper. Add to the skillet. Cook until browned on the
bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and baste liberally with the paprika
paste. Brown the other side, about 5 minutes longer, then flip again
and brush with more of the paprika paste.  Remove the chicken and set
aside.

Start cooking the egg noodles according to the package directions.

In the skillet melt the butter over medium heat. Add the olive oil,
garlic, and shallot and cook for 3 minutes.

Drain the egg noodles and mix in the garlic and shallot.

Serve the chicken over the egg noodles.
