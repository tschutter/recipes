Dr Pepper Tenderloin
--------------------

- 2 pounds beef fillet, tied with butcher twine every inch
  (preferably cut from the large end of a whole tenderloin)
- 1 cup Dr Pepper (not diet)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 6 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed

Put Dr Pepper, soy sauce, lemon juice, peppercorns, salt, and garlic
in a gallon zip-loc bag.  Seal the beef in the bag.  Refrigerate for
at least 5 hours or overnight.

Preheat a grill to medium.  Place the tenderloin on the grill,
reserving the marinade, and cover the grill.  Cook, turning
occasionally, until the meat registers 125 degrees F on a meat
thermometer for medium rare, about 40 minutes.  Transfer to a board to
rest for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the reserved marinade to a boil in a medium saucepan,
then lower the heat and simmer until slightly reduced, about 10
minutes.  Slice the beef and drizzle with the Dr Pepper sauce.
