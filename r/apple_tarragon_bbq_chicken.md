Apple Tarragon Barbecue Chicken
-------------------------------

- 1 cup apple cider
- 1/3 cup cider vinegar
- 1/3 cup sliced scallions
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 3 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons steak sauce
- 1-1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 3 pound chicken, cut up

In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except chicken.  Bring to
a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered 15 minutes.  Let cool 5
minutes.

Place chicken pieces in a large bowl.  Add apple-tarragon marinade,
reserving 1 cup.  Cover 1 to 3 hours at room temperature turning
occasionally, or refrigerate overnight.

Remove chicken from marinade, reserving 1 cup of marinade.  While
chicken is cooking, simmer reserved marinade to make a sauce.

Grill chicken pieces over medium direct heat, turning, for about 40
minutes, or broil 25 to 30 minutes, until chicken is tender.  While
chicken is cooking, simmer reserved marinade until it thickens to make
a sauce.
