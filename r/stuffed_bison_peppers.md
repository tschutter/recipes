Stuffed Bison Peppers
---------------------

- 2 cups cooked rice
<!-- -->
- 4 bell peppers (any color)
<!-- -->
- 1 onion, diced
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
<!-- -->
- 1 pound ground bison
- 4-5 roma tomatoes, diced
- dash Worcestershire sauce
- olive oil
- salt, pepper, oregano, to taste

Prepare rice according to directions.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.  Cut tops off of
bell peppers and remove seeds and insides.  Add peppers to boiling
water and keep completely under water for about 3 minutes.  Drain and
set aside.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Cook onions and garlic
until onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium sized bowl, mix rice, onion,
garlic, meat, tomatoes, and seasonings until well blended.

Drizzle a small amount of olive oil inside the peppers and arrange in
a baking dish.  Stuff the peppers with prepared filling.  Place peppers
in oven and bake for 40-50 minutes.
