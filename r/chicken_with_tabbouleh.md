Chicken with Tabbouleh
----------------------

- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 cups bulgur wheat
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2 lemons)
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
<!-- -->
- 2 whole (4 split) chicken breasts, bone in, skin on
- olive oil
- salt
- freshly ground black pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 cup minced scallions, white and green parts (1 bunch)
- 1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves (2 bunches)
- 1 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (1 bunch)
- 1 hothouse cucumber, unpeeled, halved lengthwise, seeded, and medium-diced
- 2 cups halved cherry tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

In a heat-proof bowl, pour the boiling water over the bulgur
wheat. Add the lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. Stir. Cover the bowl
with plastic wrap and allow the bulgur wheat to stand at room
temperature for about 1 hour.

Place the chicken breast on a baking sheet and rub it with olive
oil. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Roast for 35 to 40
minutes, until just cooked. Set aside until cool enough to handle.

Remove the chicken meat from the bones and discard the skin. Cut the
chicken into medium dice and add to the tabbouleh. Add the scallions,
mint, parsley, cucumber, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.

Season, to taste, and serve immediately or cover and refrigerate. The
flavors will improve as it sits.
