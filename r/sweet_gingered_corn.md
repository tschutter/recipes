Sweet Gingered Corn
-------------------

food.com adds (unrated)
- 1 teaspoon powdered ginger
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder (sounds like too much)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 2 scallions, stalks sliced

Heat oil in a large skillet over a medium flame.  Add the cumin and
ginger and saute for 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add the tomatoes
and salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook for 4 minutes, or until most of
the liquid from the tomatoes evaporates.

Add the maple syrup and corn and return to a simmer.  Cook, stirring
frequently to prevent sticking, for 5 minutes or until corn is heated
through.

Serve immediately.
