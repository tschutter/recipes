Double Chocolate Zucchini Bread
-------------------------------

- 3 cups grated zucchini
<!-- -->
- 2 cups flour
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla
- 1/2 cup sour cream
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips
- zest from one orange (optional)

<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Butter and flour 2 loaf pans and set aside.

Set shredded zucchini in a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and set
aside.

Place flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder in a small
bowl and whisk to combine.  Set aside.

With a stand or hand mixer beat oil, white sugar, brown sugar, and
eggs until combined and slightly fluffy, 1-2 minutes.  Add vanilla and
sour cream and mix until combined.

Gently press down on zucchini in strainer and discard any excess
liquid.  Add zucchini to batter.  Add zest to batter if you are using.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Take a spoonful of the flour mixture and stir in with the chocolate
chips (that will help keep them evenly distributed.)  Add the
remaining flour mixture to the batter and stir just until combined.

Mix topping ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.  Divide the
batter between the two pans, and sprinkle topping over each.

Bake in your preheated 350 degree oven for 50-60 minutes.  Let it cool
on a rack for 5-10 minutes, then remove from pans.
