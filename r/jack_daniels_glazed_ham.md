Jack Daniel's Glazed Ham
------------------------

- 4 to 6 pound ham
<!-- -->
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/3 cup whiskey
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange peel
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

Roast ham uncovered on a rack in a roasting pan.  For a fully cooked
ham, roast for about 20 minutes per pound or until the internal
temperature reaches 140 degrees.  For an uncooked ham, roast for about
30? minutes per pound or until the internal temperature reaches 160
degrees.

About 45 minutes before the ham is done, simmer a mixture of the brown
sugar, whiskey, orange peel, cloves and allspice over medium low heat
for about 15 minutes until slightly thickened.

Remove the ham from the oven and place on foil.  Baste with the glaze
and return to the oven.
