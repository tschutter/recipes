Chewy Edge Brownies
-------------------

- 12 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 5 ounces unsweetened chocolate
- 2-1/4 cups sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1-1/4 cup all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Lightly spray pan with nonstick
cooking spray.

Place the unsweetened chocolate and butter in a bowl over a pot of
lightly simmering water.  The water should not touch the bottom of the
bowl.  Stir frequently until chocolate and butter are completely
melted and remove bowl from the pot.

Stir in the sugar.  Then stir in the eggs and vanilla.  Follow with
the flour and salt, mixing just until combined.  Stir in the chocolate
chips.  Spread the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the
brownie comes out with moist crumbs.
