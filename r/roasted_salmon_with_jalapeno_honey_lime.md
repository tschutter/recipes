Roasted Salmon With Jalapeno, Honey, and Lime
---------------------------------------------

- 1/4 cup honey
- 3 medium jalapenos, thinly sliced crosswise into rings
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari
<!-- -->
- 4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1 inch thick
- olive oil
- salt
<!-- -->
- 1/2 lime
- chopped fresh cilantro
- steamed rice

*note: try doubling sauce*

Heat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Combine the honey, jalape√±os, vinegar and soy sauce in a small
saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low and simmer for
10 minutes. Set aside.

Pat the salmon fillets dry using paper towels.  Brush a 9 x 9 inch
baking pan (or other similar-size baking pan or dish) with olive oil,
then place the fillets in the pan, arranging them evenly without
crowding.  Brush the fillets generously with olive oil and sprinkle
with salt.  Pour the glaze and jalapenos over the salmon, spooning
some of the glaze onto the fish as it collects in the bottom of the
pan.

Roast the salmon for 6 minutes, then baste with the glaze.  Return to
the oven and roast until the salmon is cooked through but still
slightly rare in the center, another 6 to 8 minutes.  Spoon the glaze
in the pan over the salmon, then squeeze the lime over the salmon, and
sprinkle with salt and cilantro.

Serve over hot rice, pouring any glaze that remains in the pan over
the rice.
