Beef, Beer, and Barley Stew
---------------------------

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound beef stew meat
- 1 teaspoon salt, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 cups onions, coarsely chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 fresh thyme sprigs
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 cups carrots, sliced
- 2 cups turnips (about 1 pound), chopped and peeled
- 3/4 cup uncooked pearl barley
- 5 garlic cloves, minced and divided
- 16 ounces mushrooms, quartered
- 3 cups water
- 3 cups low sodium beef broth
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 12 ounces dark beer (such as stout)
- 3 small beets
- 3 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 teaspoon thyme leaves
- 2 tablespoons prepared horseradish

Heat oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat.  Sprinkle beef with 1/2
teaspoon slat and pepper.  Add beef to pan. Saute 10 minutes or until
browned.  Remove from pan.

Add onion, bay leaves, and thyme to pan.  Cover, reduce heat, and cook
10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Uncover.  Stir in tomato paste.  Increase heat to medium-high.  Add
carrot, turnips, barley, 4 garlic cloves, and mushrooms.  Saute 3
minutes.  Add beef, 1/2 teaspoon salt, water, broth, Worcestershire,
and beer.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat.  Simmer, covered for 1-1/2
hours.  Discard bay leaves and thyme sprigs.

While stew is simmering, trim beets leaving root and 1 inch stem on
each.  Scrub each beet with a brush.  Glace in a medium saucepan and
cover with water.  Bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat and simmer 35
minutes or until tender.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Drain and
let cool.  Rub off skins leaving root and 1 inch stem on each beet.
Cut each beet into 6 wedges.

Combine parsley, thyme leaves, and 1 garlic clove.  Ladle about 2 cups
of stew into each of 6 bowls.  Top each serving with 3 beet wedges,
1/6 of the parsley mixture, and 1 teaspoon horseradish.
