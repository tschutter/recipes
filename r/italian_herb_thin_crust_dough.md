Italian Herb Thin Crust Dough
-----------------------------

- 2/3 cup lukewarm water
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
<!-- -->
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme

Place 1/4 of the warm water in a large bowl and sprinkle a pinch of
sugar and all of the yeast into the water.  Stir until dissolved and
let sit in a warm, draft-free location for 5 minutes.  Add remaining
water and oil and stir well.  Add all remaining ingredients and stir
together until you can no longer work the dough with a spoon.  Turn
out on a lightly floured counter.  Pat the dough into a ball and
flatten from you with a rolling motion.  Rotate the dough one quarter
each time you repeat this process.  Continue kneading the dough for 5
to 10 minutes.  Place the dough in a large greased bowl and cover it
with a clean towel.  Place it in a warm, draft-free location and let
rise for 50 to 60 minutes.
