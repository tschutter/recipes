Cashew Butter Chicken
---------------------

- 2 chicken breasts
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup cashews
- 3 tablespoons butter
<!-- -->
- pasta, broken up in quarters
- 10 ounce frozen cut green beans
<!-- -->
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

Chop chicken into bite-sized pieces.  Season with salt and pepper.

Finely chop the cashews in a food processor.  Mix with the butter.

Start the pasta.  Break up the pasta, otherwise it doesn't mix well
with the other ingredients.  Add the green beans 6 minutes before the
pasta has finished cooking.

While the pasta is cooking, warm the olive oil in a skillet over
medium heat.  Add the chicken and cook 3 to 4 minutes until it is no
longer pink inside.

When the pasta is done, drain and add the chicken and cashew butter.
