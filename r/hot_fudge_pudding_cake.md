Hot Fudge Pudding Cake
----------------------

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
<!-- -->
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1-1/2 cups hot water

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 or 9-inch square baking
dish and set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder,
baking powder and salt.  Add to the dry mixture the milk, vegetable
oil, vanilla and walnuts.  Stir with a rubber spatula until combined
and spread into an even layer in the prepared pan.

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar and cocoa powder, and
sprinkle over the batter (do not stir!!). Pour the hot water evenly
over the cake (do not stir!!).

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes (40 minutes if using 9-inch pan, 45 minutes
if using an 8-inch pan) and serve warm.  When serving, invert the cake
squares onto the plate; the pudding sauce will be on top.
