Savory Molasses Chicken Breasts
-------------------------------

- 1/2 cup fresh orange juice
- 3 tablespoons ketchup
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 2 tablespoons minced ginger
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon finely grated orange zest
- 1/2 teaspoon crumbled dried sage leaves
- salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

In a gallon zip-lock bag, combine all ingredients except chicken.

Add the chicken, close the bag, and massage to coat the chicken.  Let
rest, covered, at room temperature for 30 minutes; or refrigerate,
covered, for 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Remove the chicken breasts to a
shallow baking pan to fit and pour the marinade over the breasts.
Bake for 25 minutes or until cooked through, basting often with the
pan juices.

Remove the chicken to a plate.  Pour the pan juices into a small
saucepan and bring to a boil; reduce until thickened, about 15
minutes.  Serve with the chicken.
