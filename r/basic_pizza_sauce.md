Basic Pizza Sauce
-----------------

- 6 to 8 fresh Italian plum tomatoes
- 1 cloves minced or pressed garlic
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, or 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- salt and pepper to taste

Seed tomatoes by cutting off stem top and squeezing them over the sink
to remove seed and juice.  Process tomatoes in a food processor for
just a moment to chop coarsely, or chop by hand.  Add herbs and
seasonings to taste.

If using right away, it need not be cooked; however, if it will be
refrigerated or frozen, simmer sauce over low heat for 5 to 10
minutes.  Sauce may be refrigerated in a tightly sealed container and
used within a week or two.
