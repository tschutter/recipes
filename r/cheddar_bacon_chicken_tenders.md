Cheddar Bacon Chicken Tenders
-----------------------------

- 16 ounces bacon
<!-- -->
- 2 eggs
<!-- -->
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs
- 3/4 cup cheddar cheese, finely grated
<!-- -->
- 1-1/2 pounds chicken tenders

Cook the bacon.  Cool and chop into bits.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Spray a large baking sheet with
cooking spray.

In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs.

In a separate shallow bowl, mix the bread crumbs, bacon bits, and
cheddar cheese.

Dip each piece of chicken in the egg, roll in the breading, and place

chicken.

Bake for 15-25 minutes until the chicken is no longer pink inside and
the coating is golden brown.
