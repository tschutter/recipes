Blueberry Scones
----------------

- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 3/4 cup butter
<!-- -->
- 1 large egg
- 1-1/2 cups half-and-half (or 1 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream)
- 1-1/2 cups fresh or unthawed frozen blueberries

Heat oven to 425 degrees F.  Grease large baking sheet.

In a large bowl, combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder,
salt, and cream of tartar.  With pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in
butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

Separate egg, placing the egg white in a cup and the yolk in a small
bowl.  Beat egg yolk with a fork and stir in half-and-half.  Add yolk
mixture to dry ingredients and mix lightly with a fork until mixture
clings together and forms a soft dough.

Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead gently 5 or 6
times.  Gently fold in blueberries.  Divide dough in half.  With a
lightly floured rolling pin, roll one half of dough into a 7-inch
round.  Cut into 4 wedges.  Repeat with remaining half of dough.

Place scones 1 inch apart on greased baking sheet.  Pierce tops with
tines of fork.  Brush with reserved egg white .  Sprinkle with
remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Bake scones for 15 to 18 minutes when using fresh blueberries or about
20 minutes when using frozen - or until golden brown.  Serve warm.
