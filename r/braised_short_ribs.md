Braised Short Ribs
------------------

- 8 beef short ribs
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
<!-- -->
- 6 thin slices bacon, diced
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 carrots, diced 1"
- 2 shallots, finely minced
- 1 medium onion, diced 1"
- splash of red wine
<!-- -->
- 4 cups beef broth (enough to almost cover the ribs)
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Salt and pepper the ribs, then
dredge them in the flour.  Set aside.

In a large Dutch oven or heavy bottomed pot, cook the bacon over
medium heat until completely crispy and all the fat is rendered.
Remove the bacon and set aside.  Drain off any excess fat.

Add the olive oil to the pan with the bacon fat and raise the heat to
high.  Brown the ribs on all sides, about 45 seconds per side.  Remove
the ribs and set aside.

Lower the heat to medium.  Add the carrots, shallots and onions to the
pan and cook for 2 minutes. Splash in the wine and scrape the bottom
of the pan to release all the flavorful bits of glory.  Add the broth,
1 teaspoon salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper and bring to
a boil.  Taste and add more salt if needed.  Add the ribs to the
liquid; they should be almost completely submerged.  Add the thyme and
rosemary sprigs (whole) to the liquid.  Finally, add the cooked bacon.

Put on a lid and transfer to the oven.  Cook until the ribs are
fork-tender and falling off the bone, 2.5 to 3 hours.  Remove the pan
from the oven and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes with the lid on
before serving.  At the last minute, skim the fat off the top of the
liquid. (You can also refrigerate the mixture, then remove the solid
fat from the top.)

Serve over goat cheese polenta.
