Mint And Feta Lamb Burgers
--------------------------

- 1-1/2 pounds ground lamb
- 2/3 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint
- salt
- pepper
- 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil, or as needed

In a large bowl, combine the lamb, feta, mint.  Salt and pepper to
taste.  Divide the mixture evenly into four balls.  Form each ball
into a patty no more than 3/4 inch thick.

Over medium heat, heat enough of the oil in a large nonstick skillet
to just coat the bottom.

Cook the burgers in the heated skillet for about 10 minutes.  Turn the
burgers over and continue to cook until they are cooked all the way
through, about 10 more minutes.
