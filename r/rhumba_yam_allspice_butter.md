Rhumba Yam-Allspice Butter
--------------------------

- 1/2 cup raw yams, peeled and diced
- 1/4 pound unsalted butter, brought to room temperature
- 1/2 teaspoon maple syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice

Cook the diced yams in water until they are extremely soft, then drain
them and place in a bowl. Let cool in the fridge.

Place all the ingredients into a medium-size mixing bowl, and mix well
with a hand mixer or rubber spatula until a smooth, butterlike
consistency. Chill for a few hours or, if time allows, overnight.

Makes approximately 1 cup.
