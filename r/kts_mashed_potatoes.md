KT's Real Mashed Potatoes
-------------------------

- 5 pounds red potatoes
<!-- -->
- 4-6 whole garlic cloves
<!-- -->
- 1/4 pound butter (1 stick)
- 2-1/2 cups whole milk
<!-- -->
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper

Wash potatoes, scrub, remove bad spots, and cut into equal, lime sized
pieces.  Put potatoes in a stock pot, cover with cold water.  Store in
the fridge, garage, or on the deck to cook later or put on the stove.

Add garlic and bring to a boil on high and cook, until potatoes smoosh
easily when squeezed against the side of the pot with a spoon (test
several potatoes), about 45 minutes to an hour total.

Heat butter and milk in microwave.

Drain potatoes and dump into the mixer-bowl.  Add the salt and pepper
and while mixing on slow speed add the hot milk mixture only as fast
as the potatoes will absorb it.  When all the milk and butter mixture
has been added, stop the mixer and take a taste and add a bit more
salt if needed. Resume mixing on medium-high for 20-30 seconds until
the mashers are soft and creamy, almost pourable (mixing in a little
more milk if needed) with a few small lumps.

Cover the bowl and place back in the cooking pot to keep warm until
ready to serve and then dump the mashers into a preheated bowl to
serve.
