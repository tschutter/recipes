Roast Brined Turkey
-------------------

- 1 (14 to 16 pound) frozen young turkey
<!-- -->
- 1 gallon vegetable stock
- 1 cup kosher salt
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns
- 1-1/2 teaspoons allspice berries
- 1-1/2 teaspoons chopped candied ginger
<!-- -->
- 1 gallon heavily iced water
<!-- -->
- 1 red apple, sliced
- 1/2 onion, sliced
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 cup water
<!-- -->
- 4 sprigs rosemary
- 6 leaves sage
- canola oil

2 to 3 days before roasting, begin thawing the turkey in the
refrigerator or in a cooler kept at 38 degrees F.

Combine the vegetable stock, salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, allspice
berries, and candied ginger in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.
Stir occasionally to dissolve solids and bring to a boil.  Then remove
the brine from the heat, cool to room temperature, and refrigerate.

Early on the night before you'd like to eat, combine the brine, water,
and ice in a 5-gallon bucket.  Place the thawed turkey (with innards
removed) breast side down in the brine.  If necessary, weigh down the
bird to ensure that it is fully immersed.  Cover, and refrigerate or
set in cool area for 8 to 16 hours, turning the bird once halfway
through brining.

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.  Remove the bird from the brine and
rinse inside and out with cold water.  Discard the brine.  Place the
bird on a roasting rack inside a half sheet pan and pat dry with paper
towels.

Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick and 1 cup of water and
microwave on high for 5 minutes.  Add steeped aromatics to the
turkey's cavity along with the rosemary and sage.  Tuck the wings
underneath the bird and coat the skin liberally with canola oil.

Roast the turkey on the lowest level of the oven at 500 degrees F for
30 minutes.  Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the
breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.  Set the
thermometer alarm to 161 degrees F.  A 14 to 16 pound bird should
require a total of 2 to 2-1/2 hours of roasting.  Let the turkey rest,
loosely covered with foil or a large mixing bowl for 15 minutes before
carving.
