Bourbon Marinade
----------------

- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 cup Jack Daniels Whiskey
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon ground ginger
<!-- -->
- 4 chicken breasts or pork chops
<!-- -->
- 1 tablespoon butter

Mix brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, whiskey, garlic powder and
ginger in a gallon ziplock bag.

Place meat in bag and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Bring the meat to room temperature
before cooking and place in a baking dish.

Bake for 1 hour if using chicken.  Bake for 45 minutes if using pork
chops.  Turn meat over halfway through the cooking time.

Remove the meat from the baking dish and keep warm.

Strain the marinade into a sauce pan and simmer over medium heat to
reduce it by half.  Remove from heat and stir in 1 tablespoon butter
to make the sauce creamy.  Serve over the meat.
