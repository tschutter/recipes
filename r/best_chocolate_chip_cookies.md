Best Chocolate Chip Cookies
---------------------------

- 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 1 standard ice cube (about 2 tablespoons frozen water)
<!-- -->
- 10 ounces (about 2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon table salt
<!-- -->
- 5 ounces (about 3/4 cup) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
<!-- -->
- 5 ounces (~ 1/2 tightly packed cup + 2 tablespoons) dark brown sugar
<!-- -->
- 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips

Coarse sea salt for garnish

Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently
swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown
and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15
seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in ice cube, transfer
to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes,
whisking occasionally. (Alternatively, whisk over an ice bath to
hasten process).

Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large
bowl. Place granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of
a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium high
speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in
thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.

Fit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled
(it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the
edges), Add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in
stand mixer. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add
flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined but some
dry flour still remains, about 15 seconds. Add chocolate and mix on
low until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to
an airtight container and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up
to three days.

When ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper and lower middle
positions and preheat oven to 325Â°F. Using a 1-ounce ice cream scoop
or a spoon, place scoops of cookie dough onto a non-stick or
parchment-lined baking sheet. Each ball should measure approximately 3
tablespoons in volume and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on
each sheet. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown around edges
but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top
and bottom half way through baking.

Remove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle
very lightly with coarse salt and gently press it down to embed. Let
cool for 2 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool
completely.

Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight
container, plastic bag, or cookie jar at room temperature for up to 5
days.
