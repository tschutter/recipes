Quinoa Salad
------------

- 1-1/2 cups quinoa
<!-- -->
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1 teaspoon dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon honey
- several shakes of hot sauce

<!-- -->
- 15 ounce can rinsed and drained garbanzo beans
- 1/2 cup dried cherries or cranberries, softened in hot water and drained
- 1/2 cup slivered almonds
- 1/2 pound fresh baby spinach cut up with shears
- 1 cucumber, diced and seeded

Rinse and cook quinoa in 3 cups boiling water for 12 minutes,
covered. Remove from heat and let sit for 15 minutes until liquid is
absorbed, stirring occasionally.

Create dressing by combining olive oil, rice wine vinegar, lime juice,
dijon mustard, and honey. Season with hot sauce, salt, and pepper.

Add dressing and the green onion to the warm quinoa for better
absorption and to slightly cook the green onions.  Let cool then
refrigerate for 1/2 hour.

Stir in rest of ingredients.  Better if left overnight to marinate
before serving.
