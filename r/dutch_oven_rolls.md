Dutch Oven Rolls
----------------

- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 1/8 teaspoon sugar
<!-- -->
- 1 cup warm milk
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3 cups flour

This recipe fits in a 12" Dutch oven.  Approximately 1 dozen rolls.

Mix dry yeast in water, sprinkle the 1/8 teaspoon sugar over the yeast
mixture to activate.

Mix milk, butter, salt and sugar, stir well.  Add one-half amount of
flour, mix thoroughly.  Add yeast mixture, stir well, then add the
rest of the flour (retaining 1/2 cup).  The dough will be stiff.

Sprinkle some of the remaining flour on a flat surface.  Knead until
dough is smooth.  Place dough in greased bowl, cover and let rise
until double in bulk (approximately 1 hour).

Shape dough into smooth rolls and place in greased Dutch oven.  Cover
and let rise until double in bulk.

Place the Dutch oven on one or two shovels of hot coals and also put a
shovel of coals on the top of the lid.  Bake approximately 10-15
minutes from top and bottom.  Remove Dutch oven from coals and
continue baking with coals on top for approximately 10-15 minutes or
until rolls are golden brown.
