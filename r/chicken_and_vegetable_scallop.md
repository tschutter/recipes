-----------------------------

- 2 cups cubed cooked chicken (about 4 breasts)
- 1 10 ounce package frozen corn, thawed
- 1 10 ounce package frozen peas, thawed
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 3 tablespoons flour

- 1/2 cup milk
<!-- -->
- 2 eggs, beaten
<!-- -->
- 1 cup chunky seasoned bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Boil chicken until no longer pink inside.  Cut into 1 inch cubes.

Combine chicken, corn, and peas in a 13x9x2-inch greased baking dish.

In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.  Add onion and cook
until soft, about 3 minutes.  Blend in flour, salt, and pepper.  Cook
1 to 2 minutes without browning.  Gradually whisk in chicken broth and
milk.  Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and
smooth.

Remove from heat and stir in eggs.  Pour sauce over chicken mixture.

Combine bread crumbs and cheese in a small bowl and sprinkle on top of
casserole.   Cover with foil.  Bake for 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake
10 minutes, until lightly browned on top.
