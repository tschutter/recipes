Parmesan Crescents

- 2 cups Bisquick mix
- 1/2 cup cold water
- 3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
- 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Heat oven to 425 degrees F.

Mix Bisquick and cold water until soft dough forms; beat vigorously 30
seconds. Turn onto surface well dusted with Bisquick. Gently roll in
Bisquick to coat; shape into ball. Knead 10 times. Roll or pat into
a 14-inch circle.

Spread with butter; sprinkle with cheese. Cut into 12 wedges. Roll up,
beginning at rounded edges. Place rolls, with points underneath, on
ungreased cookie sheet; curve slightly.

Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.
