Salt and Pepper Biscuits
------------------------

- 2-1/2 cups flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, cut up
<!-- -->
- 2-1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 tablespoons warm water (100 to 110 degrees F)
- 1 cup buttermilk
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 teaspoon onion seeds
- 1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper
- 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt

Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, then stir in the buttermilk.
Add to the dry ingredients, and stir until blended.

Lightly knead on a floured surface.  Roll out the dough into a 6x9
inch rectangle.  Cut into 6 3x3 inch squares.  Place on a baking sheet
lined with parchment paper.  Cover and let rise 1 hour.

Heat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Brush the tops of the biscuits with
the cream.  Sprinkle with the onion seeds, then pepper and salt.

Bake until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove to a wire rack to
cool slightly.
