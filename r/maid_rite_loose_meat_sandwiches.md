Maid-Rite Loose Meat Sandwiches
-------------------------------

- 1 cup warm water
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- 1 teaspoon low sodium beef base (or a bouillon cube)
- 1 teaspoon low sodium chicken base (or a bouillon cube)
- 2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon low sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
<!-- -->
- 3 pounds lean ground beef, uncooked
<!-- -->
- 8 hamburger buns

Set slow cooker to high.  Add all ingredients except beef.  Stir to
combine.  Add beef and stir until all combined and beef is completely
coated.

Cover and cook for 1 hour.  Stir occasionally to break up ground beef.
Uncover after 1 hour of cook time.  Continue cooking on high for 2.5
to 3 hours (with the lid off), until most of the liquid has cooked
off.  Continue to stir occasionally and break up any chunks of beef.

Using a slotted spoon, serve a heaping spoonful on a warm bun and add
pickles.
