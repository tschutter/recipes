Chicken With Mushroom Sauce
---------------------------

- 1/2 cup flour
- 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (1 1/2 pounds)
- salt and black pepper
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
<!-- -->
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup chicken broth

Place the flour in a shallow bowl.  Season the chicken with 1/2
teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and coat with the flour (tapping
off any excess).

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. In batches,
cook the chicken until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side; transfer to a
plate.

Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook, tossing, until browned, 4
to 6 minutes.

Return the chicken to the skillet, add the wine and chicken broth, and
simmer until cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Serve with rice.
