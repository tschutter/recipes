Cinnamon Balls
--------------

- 1-1/2 cups ground almonds
- 1/3 cup superfine sugar
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 egg whites
confectioner's sugar, for dredging

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a large baking sheet
with oil.

Mix together the ground almonds, sugar and cinnamon. Whisk the egg
whites until they begin to stiffen and fold enough into the almonds to
make a fairly firm mixture.

Wet your hands with cold water and roll small spoonfuls of the mixture
into balls. Place these on the baking sheet.

Bake for about 15 minutes in the center of the oven. They should be
slightly soft inside - too much cooking will make them hard and tough.

With spatula remove from baking sheet to cool. Sift a few tablespoons
of confectioner's sugar onto a plate and when the cinnamon balls are
cold slide them onto the plate. Shake gently to completely cover the
balls in sugar and store in an airtight container or in the freezer.
