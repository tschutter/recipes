Cheesey Italian Spaghetti Squash
--------------------------------

- 8 inch spaghetti squash
<!-- -->
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 pound sliced mushrooms
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley
- 3 teaspoons basil
- dash of thyme
- salt
- pepper
- 2 medium chopped tomatoes
<!-- -->
- 1 cup cottage or ricotta cheese

Slice the squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds.  Place
the squash facedown on a buttered tray.  Bake at 375 degrees F for
about 30 minutes, or until easily pierced.

While squash bakes, saute onions and garlic.  Add mushrooms, oregano,
parsley, basil, and thyme.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Add
tomatoes and cook until most of the liquid evaporates.

Cool squash until handleable.  Scoop out insides.

Combine in a buttered casserole the squash, saute, cottage cheese,
mozzarella cheese, and corn flakes.  Top with lots of grated parmesan
cheese.

Bake uncovered at 375 degrees F for 40 minutes.
