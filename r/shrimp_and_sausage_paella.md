Shrimp and Sausage Paella
-------------------------

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 ounces hot Italian sausage, cut into 1/2 inch thick rounds
- 1-1/2 cups long-grain white or brown rice
<!-- -->
- 1 cup chopped onion, frozen
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
<!-- -->
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 cup bottled clam juice or water
- 1 16 ounce can stewed tomatoes
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
<!-- -->
- 12 jumbo shrimp (about 12 ounces)
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- 1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley

Heat oil in a 4-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  Add sausage
and, stirring constantly, cook 3 minutes or until browned on all
sides.  Remove to a plate with a slotted spoon.

Stir rice, frozen onion, and turmeric into pan drippings until onion
is thawed, about 1 minute.

Add broth, clam juice, tomatoes, and wine.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce
heat to low and cover.  Simmer 22 minutes for white rice, 38 minutes
if using brown rice.

Stir in browned sausage, shrimp, frozen peas and parsley.  Cover and
simmer 6 to 8 minutes until rice is tender and most of the liquid is
absorbed.  Remove from heat.  Let stand covered 3 minutes until all
liquid is absorbed and shrimp are pink and opaque.
