Butterscotch Rice Pudding
-------------------------

- 1 cup water
- pinch of salt
- 1/3 cup short-grain rice
- 1-1/2 cups milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 1-quart ovenproof casserole
dish.

Bring the cup of water to a boil in a large saucepan. As soon as the
water boils, add the salt and the rice. Cover and cook over low heat
for 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Pour in the milk
and simmer for 5 or 10 minutes, just until the milk comes to a
boil. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

In a small, heavy-bottomed frying pan, melt the butter over medium
heat. Add the cream and the brown sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce the
heat to low, and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the
cream mixture into the rice. Stir well. Spoon this into the casserole
dish.

Bake for 20 minutes or until the pudding is thick and has a golden
crust. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
