Carrot Chicken Salad
--------------------

- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- salt
- pepper
<!-- -->
- 15 ounce can chickpeas
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin
<!-- -->
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons tahini
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
<!-- -->
- 1 pound carrots
- 1/4 cup parsley
- 1/4 cup salted pistachios

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

Coat chicken thighs in oil and place in a baking dish.  Season with
salt and pepper.  Roast for 25 minutes and remove.

Drain and rinse chickpeas.  Pat dry with paper towels.  Toss chickpeas
with olive oil, sea salt, and cumin.  Spread in a single layer on a
sheet pan.  Roast 25-30 minutes or until browned and crisped, tossing
occasionally.  Check frequently at the end of roasting as they will
quickly burn after the moisture is gone.

Once chicken has cooled, chop or pull into bite-sized pieces.

Whisk lemon juice, tahini, olive oil, water, garlic, sea salt, and red
pepper flakes to taste in a small bowl.

Peel and coarsely grate carrots.  Coarsely chop parsley and combine
with chicken and carrots in a large bowl.  Toss with two-thirds of the
dressing.

Sprinkle with chickpeas and pistachios.  Serve with remaining dressing
on the side.
