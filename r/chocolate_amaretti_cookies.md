Chocolate Amaretti Cookies
--------------------------

- 2 cups / 195 grams almond flour
- 1 cup / 224 grams granulated sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
- pinch of salt
<!-- -->
- 3 large egg whites
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
<!-- -->
- granulated sugar, for rolling
- powdered sugar, for rolling
- dried cherries

Heat oven to 325 degrees F.  Line two baking sheets with parchment.

Stir together almond flour, granulated sugar, cocoa and salt in a
large mixing bowl.

In a small bowl, put egg whites and almond extract.  Beat with a fork
until frothy.

Add egg white mixture to almond flour mixture, and stir well with a
large spoon or spatula to form a sticky dough.

Use a teaspoon to scoop a walnut-sized blob of dough.  Gently roll
between palms into a 1-inch round.  Toss lightly in a bowl of
granulated sugar, then generously in a bowl of powdered sugar to coat
well.  Repeat with the rest of the dough.  Place on parchment paper 2
inches apart; there should be 12 cookies per sheet.  Push a dried
cherry in the center of each cookie.

Bake on the center rack until a thin crust has formed and the surface
is crinkly, 15 to 20 minutes.  Do not overbake - the goal is a chewy
center.  Repeat with the rest of the dough until all of the cookies
are baked.  Let cool, and serve.
