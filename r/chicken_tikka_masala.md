Chicken Tikka Masala
--------------------

- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 2 teaspoons turmeric
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
<!-- -->
- 1 cup whole-milk yogurt
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice
- 3 cloves garlic, chrushed
- 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
- 2 pounds cooked chicken, cut into 1-1/2 inch pieces
<!-- -->
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee
- 1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 3 cloves garlic, chrushed
- 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
- 2 serrano peppers, finely chopped
<!-- -->
- 14-1/2 ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
- 14-1/2 ounce can crushed fire-roasted tomatoes
- 1/2 cup whole-milk yogurt
- 3/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup water
<!-- -->
- 1-1/2 cups coarsely chopped cilantro leaves

In a small bowl combine garam masala, turmeric, cumin, paprika,
coriander, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper.

In a medium bowl, whisk yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger and half
of the spice mixture together.  Add chicken and toss to coat.  Cover
and chill at least 4 hours or overnight.

Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium heat.
Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned in
spots, about 5 to 8 minutes.  Add tomato paste, garlic, ginger,
serrano peppers, and remaining spice mixture.  Cook, stirring
frequently until spices are fragrant and tomato paste has started
caramelizing on the bottom of the pot, about 2 minutes.

Add tomatoes, yogurt, heavy cream and 1 cup water.  Scraping up any
bits from the bottom of the pot.  Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to
medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally until flavors meld and the
sauce is thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove from heat and
cover until chicken is ready (or after cooling, refrigerate if
marinating chicken for more than 4 hours).

Once chicken has finished marinating, turn on the broiler and place
oven rack about 6 inches away from heat source.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminium foil and place a wire rack
inside the pan.  Remove chicken from the marinade, scraping off any
excess, and place the pieces on the rack.  Broil just until lightly
charred in spots, 5 to 7 minutes on the first side, before flipping
pieces and broiling an additional 2 to 3 minutes.

Bring tomato sauce to a simmer if it is not already.  Mix in remaining
marinade.  Add chicken.  Continue to simmer until chicken is cooked
through and sauce is thickened nicely, 10 to 15 minutes.

Divide chicken among four bowls and top with cilantro.  Serve with
basmati rice or naan for dipping.
