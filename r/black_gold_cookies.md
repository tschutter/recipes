Black Gold Cookies
------------------

- 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 10 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped into 1/4" pieces
- 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped into 1/4" pieces
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Combine the flour, baking powder
and salt.

Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
heat.  With the heat on, place 6 ounces semisweet chocolate, the
unsweetened chocolate, and butter in the top half of the double
boiler.  Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate and butter until
completely melted and smooth, about 6 minutes.  Set aside until
needed.

Place the eggs, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer.
Beat on medium 6 minutes until soft, scraping down the sides of the
bowl as you go.  Add the melted chocolate and beat on medium for 1
minute until incorporated.  Add the sifted dry ingredients and the
remaining 4 ounces of semisweet chocolate and mix on low speed until
just incorporated, about 30 seconds.  Remove the bowl from the mixer
and use a rubber spatula to finish mixing the dough until thouroughly
combined.

Using a heaping tablespoon of dough for each cookie, portion 12
cookies onto each baking sheet.  Bake for 9 to 10 minutes.
