Gingerbread Star Cookies
------------------------

- 3-1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- pinch of salt
- 2 teaspoons ginger
- 1-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 3/4 cup unsalted softened butter
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 2/3 cup molasses
granulated sugar for topping

In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon,
nutmeg and cloves.  Set aside.

In large bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar.  Stir in lightly
beaten egg.  Add in molasses and mix well.  Stir in flour mixture
until well combined.

Separate dough in half, cover each half up in saran wrap. Place in
refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly spray sheet with
PAM.  Lightly flour your counter, and roll out each disc one at a
time, about 1/4 inch thick with floured rolling pin.  Use star cookie
cutter or cookie cutter of your choice.

Sprinkle each cookie with granulated sugar and place cookie onto
prepared baking sheet.  Bake for 9-11 minutes until edges are just
starting to brown.  Take out and place on cooling rack.
