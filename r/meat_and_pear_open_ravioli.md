Meat and Pear Open Ravioli
--------------------------

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 4 slices bacon, diced
- 1 sweet Italian sausage
- 1 large pear, thinly sliced with peel left on
- 2 tablespoons golden or regular raisins
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 3 to 4 small sage leaves
- 1 pound calamarata or other tube pasta
- zest of 1/2 lemon
- 1/3 cup grana padano or other aged cheese, or more to taste
- dash of ground cinnamon
- freshly grated nutmeg
- minced fresh parsley
- salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 or 3 amaretti cookies, crushed

In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add bacon and
cook until crisp, about 5 minutes.

Remove sausage from casing and crumble it into the pan; cook until
browned. Add pear, raisins, garlic and sage. Cook mixture until pears
are soft.

Meanwhile, boil pasta in salted water until it is almost al
dente. Drain, saving a cup of cooking water. Toss drained pasta into
the sauce with a few tablespoons of cooking liquid.

Stir well and cook, adding more cooking liquid if needed, until pasta
is al dente.

Stir in the zest and season with grated cheese, cinnamon, nutmeg and
parsley to taste. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve pasta topped with a sprinkling of amaretti crumbs.
