Whole Wheat Jalapeno Cheddar Scones
-----------------------------------

- 1/2 cup butter
<!-- -->
- 2-1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
<!-- -->
- 1 jalapeno (finely diced)
- 4 ounces sharp cheddar (diced)
- 2 eggs (lightly beaten)
- 1/2 cup milk
<!-- -->
- 1 egg
- salt
- pepper

Place the butter in the freezer for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper, or lightly grease the pan if you do not have the paper.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.

Prepare your jalapeno and cheese.  If you want the spice of the
jalapeno, leave the seeds and membrane; if you like it milder, remove
them and chop up only the pepper itself.  Cutting the cheese into
cubes rather than grating it means you will have pockets of gooey
cheese that contrast nicely with the scone.

Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it directly into the
flour mixture.  Use a cheese grater because it is the best way to
break up butter without melting it.  Using your hands, gently squish
the butter into the flour until everything is incorporated but not
smooth.  The chunks of butter will create flaky scones.  Add the
jalapeno, cheese, eggs, and milk to the bowl.  Use your hands to
gently mix everything until it just comes together.  It will probably
be a little shaggy, but thatâ€™s just fine.

Sprinkle flour on a clean countertop and dump the dough onto it.
Gently shape the dough into a disc about 1-1/2 inch thick.  Cut the
dough into six triangles, like a pizza, and move them to the cookie
sheet.

In a small bowl, gently beat the egg for the egg wash.  Brush it over
the scones, then sprinkle salt and pepper over each one.  Bake for 25
minutes or until the scones are golden brown.
