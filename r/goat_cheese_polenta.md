Goat Cheese Polenta
-------------------

- 4 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup cornmeal
<!-- -->
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 3 ounces soft goat cheese
- 1 teaspoon rosemary

Place chicken stock in a medium pan and bring to a boil.  Pour
cornmeal into the boiling stock in a thin stream, whisking as you
pour.

Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for about 40 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Add up to 1 cup more water as necessary, to keep soft
enough to stir.  Grains should be swollen and taste cooked, not raw.

Add salt, butter, goat cheese, and rosemary.  Stir until melted.

Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 5 minutes to thicken.
