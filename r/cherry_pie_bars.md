Cherry Pie Bars
---------------

- 2-1/2 cups dried cherries
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
<!-- -->
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
<!-- -->
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 3 cups oatmeal (quick oats)
<!-- -->
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- powdered sugar for dusting

In a small saucepan, combine dried cherries, water, sugar, and lemon
juice.  Bring to a boil, turn down the heat and let simmer 8-10
minutes until it thickens.  Take off heat and set aside.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line a 9-by-13 inch baking pan with
foil, leaving foil coming up the sides for easy removal.  Spray
lightly with a non-stick cooking spray.

In a small bowl, combine flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda.  Set
aside.

In a large bowl, beat softened butter and brown sugar until smooth.
Add eggs and vanilla.  Beat until well combined.  Add in flour
mixture, mix until just incorporated.  Add oatmeal and stir until
batter is combined.

Pour a little more than half of the batter into the prepared baking
pan.  Smooth out evenly in pan.  Pour prepared cherry mixture on top
and spread evenly.  Add remaining batter over top of cherries and
smooth.  It won't be enough to cover all the way to edges, and that's
OK.  Sprinkle sliced almonds over top.

Bake for 25 minutes, until top is golden brown.  Take out and let
cool.  Grab foil, and pull bars out of pan.  Fold down edges of foil.
Dust with powdered sugar.  Cut into 16 bars.
