Potlatch Salmon
---------------

- 1 whole salmon
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- juice of 1 lemon
- 3 teaspoons dry mustard
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
heavy-duty foil

Butterfly salmon; remove head, tail and fins.  Run knife down backbone
of fish until it opens flat, careful not to cut through.

Coat foil lightly with cooking spray.  Place salmon skin-side down on
foil.  Spread softened butter over flesh of salmon.  Drizzle with
lemon juice and dry mustard.  Cover with brown sugar, using more sugar
if needed.

Place foil with fish on barbecue grill over low heat, cover.  Bake for
20 to 30 minutes. Salmon is cooked when flesh flakes easily.
