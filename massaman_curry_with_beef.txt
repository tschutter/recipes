Massaman Curry With Beef

3 Russet potatoes

3 tablespoons Thai curry paste
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons brown sugar
3 tablespoons fish sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 13.5 ounce can coconut milk
2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca

1-1/2 pounds beef chuck roast

1 fresh lime, juiced (about 2-3 tablespoons)
1/3 cup peanut butter

Peel potatoes and cut into fairly large chunks. Place potatoes in the
bottom of the slow cooker.

In a medium bowl, combine curry paste, ginger, brown sugar, fish
sauce, Worcestershire sauce, coconut milk, and tapioca.  Whisk until
it is smooth.  Pour over the potatoes in the slow cooker.

Cut beef into bite-size cubes and place cubed beef in the slow cooker.
Press to submerge in the liquid.

Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours, until
potatoes are soft and beef is tender.

Stir in the lime juice and peanut butter.  Top with peanuts and
cilantro, if desired and serve over rice.
