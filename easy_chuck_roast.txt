Easy Chuck Roast

3-4 pound chuck roast
2 onions
1 pound carrots
2 sweet potatoes, peeled, optional
salt and pepper
1 teaspoon basil
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon rosemary
1 teaspoon garlic
1.5 cups water or broth

Marinate in spices at least 10 minutes, though several hours is
better.

Brown meat on all sides in a skillet on medium-high heat to lock in
juices. (optional step that enhances flavor)

Place roast along with sliced onions and 1-1.5 cups of water or beef
broth in a crock pot.

After two hours, rough chop carrots and sweet potatoes and add to
crock pot. They can be added at the beginning but they will be much
softer at the end.

Cook for 5 to 7 hours in the crock pot.

Let sit 10 minutes before cutting. Slice against the grain.
