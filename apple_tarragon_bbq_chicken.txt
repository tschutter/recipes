Apple Tarragon Barbecue Chicken

1 cup apple cider
1/3 cup cider vinegar
1/3 cup sliced scallions
1/4 cup vegetable oil
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons steak sauce
1-1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

1 3 pound chicken, cut up

In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except chicken.  Bring to
a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered 15 minutes.  Let cool 5
minutes.

Place chicken pieces in a large bowl.  Add apple-tarragon marinade.
Cover and marinate, turning occasionally, 1 to 3 hours at room
temperature, or refrigerate overnight.

Grill chicken pieces over medium direct heat, turning, for about 40
minutes, or broil 25 to 30 minutes, until chicken is tender.
